/*
 * Simplified Virtual Wire compatible library for PIC microcontrollers.
 * It is based on the original VirtualWire 1.20 available for Arduino at
 * http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/arduino/
 *
 * Some simplifications were made to make it fit inside PIC16 mid-range devices.
 * Half-duplex mode only, with a shared buffer for TX and RX.
